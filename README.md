I tested cloning this repository and opening it in android studio, this seemed to cause issues.

It works fine if you download the zip file for 4-application, extract it and then open it in android studio.

This could just be a me issue however.

Also let me know if you want me to delete the account in firebase auth to test validation on the date of birth selector since it can only be done once


To test error handling on the login, since once youre logged in you can't test it again, make sure the dob cant be in the future or older than 110 years old (so 111+)

During the development of my app, I faced challenges that required creative problem-solving. For instance, the Google Photos API would throw security exceptions when reloading the app, leading me to compromise and use local storage instead. This consumed much time and prevented me from implementing additional features, such as notifications to remind users of past events and a memory game to enhance engagement.

If I were to remake the app, I would store all data in cloud storage despite potential risks to ensure that users could access their memories from any device. Additionally, I would prioritize resolving issues related to APIs to ensure smooth functioning and enable the implementation of new features. 

With more time, I would consider enhancing the user interface by adding customization options, such as allowing users to increase the size of the text on the app. I would also explore gamification techniques to increase user engagement and motivation to use the app regularly. This would also require the user to keep remidning themselves of their memories

Overall, developing the app was a valuable learning experience, and I am proud of the end result despite the limitations. I would approach future projects with a greater understanding of the importance of API management and cloud storage while being more proactive in finding solutions to issues that arise.
